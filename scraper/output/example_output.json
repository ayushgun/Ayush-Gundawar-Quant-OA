These kinds of reports are triggered by a bank when its liabilities are greater than its assets. Broeksmit found the breach report in a cache of documents belonging to his father, who was an executive at DBTCA and Deutsche Bank, after he committed suicide in early 2014. Examining his father\u2019s emails and files soon after his passing, Broeksmit reviewed the breach report which covered all liabilities of DBTC, the holding company for DBTCA, according to bank documents.*\n\nVal was tweeting about reaching a trillion dollar evaluation in crypto and was even giving away crypto via Twitter to whom ever responded with details."

The release comes after the collective announced it had hacked Russia\u2019s central bank earlier this week, a claim that was denied by the monetary authority in Moscow.\n\nAnonymous Publishes Leaked Bank of Russia Files\n\nA group affiliated with the international hacktivist collective Anonymous, identified by the Twitter handle @Thblckrbbtworld (The Black Rabbit World), has announced it leaked 28GB of data obtained from the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). Another Twitter account associated with the hackers, @YourAnonTV (Anonymous TV), confirmed the news.\n\nOn Thursday, Anonymous said it had hacked the CBR and vowed to release more than 35,000 files within the next 48 hours. According to the statement, they contain some of the regulator\u2019s \u201csecret agreements\u201d among other documents. Bank of Russia rejected the claim insisting that none of its information systems had been hacked.\n\nThe latest move by Anonymous comes after it declared a cyberwar on the Russian Federation over its decision to invade Ukraine. The group threatened to disrupt Russia\u2019s internet, targeted the websites of the Kremlin, the State Duma, and the Defense Ministry as well as state-run television channels such as Russia Today (RT) and some streaming platforms.\n\nThe CBR\u2019s documents have been distributed to various online points, the hacking group noted, adding it will share them through different links if the ones it has provided are censored. According to a post by the BBC Russian Service, quoted by Forklog, in the files are hundreds of audit reports and information on bank owners.\n\nParallel to the military conflict on the ground, Russia and Ukraine have also clashed in the cyberspace. Just before Russian troops crossed the border in late February, a number of Ukrainian websites were attacked reportedly by hackers supporting Moscow. The government in Kyiv has been recruiting experts for its cyberforce who have been allegedly involved in both defensive and offensive operations."

There won\u2019t be an official declaration, and Russia is already disputing the designation, but if investors don\u2019t have their money by the deadline, there will be an \u201cevent of default\u201d on Monday morning, according to the bond documents.\r  \n\r  \nOut of Time\r  \nRussia's grace period on missed bond payments in May is about to expire\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSource: Bloomberg News\r  \n\r  \nIncludes euro and dollar payments. Figures rounded.\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s largely a symbolic development for now, given that Russia is already an economic, financial and political outcast across most of the world. But it showcases how the US, Europe and others have tightened the screws since the invasion started in February to make it all-but impossible for Russia to conduct what would otherwise be normal financial business.\r  \n\r  \nFor Russia, it will mark its first foreign default since the Bolshevik repudiation of Czarist-era debts in 1918. The country tipped very near to such a moment earlier this year, but managed a last-ditch escape by switching payment methods. That alternative avenue was subsequently shut off in May -- just days before the $100 million was due -- when the US closed a sanctions loophole that had allowed American investors to receive sovereign bond payments.\r  \n\r  \nNow the question is what happens next, as markets are faced with the unique scenario of a defaulted borrower which has the willingness and resources to pay, but can\u2019t. \r  \n\r  \nMajor ratings agencies would usually be the ones to issue a default declaration, but sanctions bar them from Russian business. Bondholders could group together to make their own statement, but they may prefer to wait to monitor the war in Ukraine and the level of sanctions as they try to figure out the chance of getting their money back, or at least some of it.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cA declaration of default is a symbolic event,\u201d said Takahide Kiuchi, an economist at Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo. \u201cThe Russian government has already lost the opportunity to issue dollar-denominated debt. Already as of now, Russia can\u2019t borrow from most foreign countries.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAs the penalties on Russian authorities, banks and individuals have increasingly cut off payment routes, Russia has argued that its met its obligations to creditors by transferring the May payments to a local paying agent, even though investors don\u2019t have the funds in their own accounts.\r  \n\r  \nEarlier this week, it made other transfers in rubles, despite the fact that the bonds in question don\u2019t allow that payment option.\r  \n\r  \nFinance Minister Anton Siluanov has cited \u201cforce-majeure\u201d as a justification for the currency switch, calling the situation a \u201cfarce.\u201d The legal argument of force majeure hasn\u2019t historically encompassed sanctions, according to lawyers who spoke to Bloomberg earlier this month.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere is every ground to suggest that in artificially barring the Russian Federation from servicing its foreign sovereign debt, the goal is to apply the label of \u2018default\u2019,\u201d Siluanov said Thursday. \u201cAnyone can declare whatever they like and can try to apply such a label. But anyone who understands the situation knows that this is in no way a default.\u201d"

				"body": "Chinese developers have suffered a meltdown of at least $90 billion in stocks and dollar bonds this year, with a bursting housing bubble and an intensifying debt crisis threatening to inflict even more pain. \n\nChinese builders have lost about $55 billion in share value since 2022 began, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence stock gauge. The sector\u2019s dollar notes have fallen more than $35 billion, show calculations based on a Bloomberg bond index, the constituents of which can change over time. The wipeouts have pushed developer stocks down to levels not seen in a decade and China\u2019s junk dollar notes to record lows.  \n\nPessimism about the industry\u2019s outlook has become more entrenched after Beijing signaled that homeowners, not builders, are the priority of current efforts to stabilize China\u2019s slumping housing market. Longer term, an aging population and a policy shift that seeks to redefine real estate as a form of public goods means the sector\u2019s boom era may have already passed. \n\n\u201cThe aim of the rescue measures is to save the property market and household confidence, but not the developers,\u201d said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis SA, referring to Beijing\u2019s recent moves to ensure completion of stalled projects. \u201cAs it is unlikely to see significant policy changes, the golden age of fast revenue growth and high leverage for property developers is probably over.\u201d \n\nChinese builders\u2019 fortunes have decidedly worsened this year following a relentless official campaign to curb their debt expansion and a year-long slump in home sales. This has led to an unprecedented cash crunch that is spreading risks to the financial system and also threatens social stability.                 \n\nTo investors\u2019 disappointment, measures to shore up developers\u2019 finances have been largely piecemeal. Steps have included a generalized call for banks to boost lending and slow progress on a reported plan to launch a state rescue fund. Instead, authorities appear more preoccupied with appeasing angry buyers of unfinished homes amid a rare boycott on mortgage payments.   \n\nAfter hitting its lowest level since 2012 earlier this week, the Bloomberg Intelligence gauge of Chinese property stocks has lost 27% this year, adding to a 34% decline for all of 2021 and in stark contrast to 80%-plus annual gains enjoyed earlier this century. \n\nThe pain is even deeper in the country\u2019s high-yield dollar bond market, where developers still dominate and once had their debt counted as investor darlings. A Bloomberg gauge tracking the sector hit its lowest-ever level this week amid fresh signs of repayment struggle in the sector. Chinese borrowers have defaulted on a record $28.8 billion of offshore bonds this year, nearly all of that by builders.\n\nThe median dollar-bond price of Chinese real estate firms was 16 cents, versus 40 cents in March, with about 80% of issuance trading below 50 cents, Bloomberg Intelligence estimated in late July. These so-called distressed levels reflect investors\u2019 low expectations for getting their money back on time. \n\nWith yields around 25%, this once-vibrant offshore market is virtually inaccessible to Chinese developers. And while high-grade borrowers such as China Vanke Co. remain able to tap cheap domestic funding, they are no longer appealing to many investors either given bleak long-run prospects the industry faces.\n\n\u201cThere is no polarization between better-quality and distressed developers anymore,\u201d said Carl Wong, head of fixed income at Avenue Asset Management Ltd. \u201cIt is domino falling.\u201d\n\nAs economic and population growth slows, China\u2019s property market will likely face an irreversible glut in coming years. Top leaders\u2019 repeated pledge that housing is for living and not for speculation, as well as a campaign to ramp up the supply of public housing, means real estate will no longer be a high-margin business.   \n\n\u201cLonger term, there will be a change in the real estate business model,\u201d said Andrew Chan, a credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cThe industry may turn out to be more state-dominated, so in a sense property prices could be \u2018controlled\u2019 -- which is in line with the Chinese goal of social stability and quelling social inequality.\u201d"

				"body": "Centrist Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) on Tuesday shot down President Biden\u2019s new plan to raise $360 billion in revenue by imposing a 20 percent minimum tax on billionaires, a proposal the president formally unveiled Monday in his budget request to Congress.\n\nManchin says he doesn\u2019t support the president\u2019s plan to tax the unrealized gains of billionaires, which would set a new precedent by taxing the value an asset accrues in theory before it is actually sold and converted into cash.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tax something that\u2019s not earned. Earned income is what we\u2019re based on,\u201d he told The Hill. \u201cThere\u2019s other ways to do it. Everybody has to pay their fair share.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody has to pay their fair share, that\u2019s for sure. But unrealized gains is not the way to do it, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he added.\n\nManchin\u2019s opposition means Biden\u2019s proposal is likely dead only a day after the White House unveiled it.\n\nIt could be significantly restructured to avoid taxing unrealized gains, which would pose the big challenge of trying to make up the lost revenues.\n\nThe problem with taxing just the regular income of billionaires is that many of the nation\u2019s richest individuals, such as Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, have been able to pay little or nothing in income tax by not declaring income.\n\nInstead, the ultra-rich often can take out loans secured by the value of their assets to finance their lavish lifestyles.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what they do. They go to their accountant. They tell their accountant, \u2018Make sure I don\u2019t make any income, any salary.\u2019 And then they say, \u2018Make sure I can buy, borrow and die.\u2019 And nobody knew anything about that years ago, and now people are pretty up on it,\u201d said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who has announced his own proposal to tax the unrealized gains of billionaires.\n\nWyden says that imposing a minimum 20 percent tax on billionaires is about making sure they pay a similar percentage of their wealth in taxes as middle-class Americans.\n\nHe called Biden\u2019s proposal \u201csolid.\u201d\n\nStructuring a tax on unrealized capital gains is complicated because the value of assets can fluctuate.\n\n\u201cThe problem with that particular tax is that it\u2019s a tax on unrealized gains,\u201d said Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D.), a member of the Finance Committee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially taxing people before they actually get the income, and that seems like a really dangerous precedent in tax law because if you have a gain one year and then a huge loss the next year, how\u2019s the government going to pay people back for their losses?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a principle in our tax policy that a gain has to be actually realized, income has to be received before it can be taxed, and this completely undermines that principle,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a wealth tax basically, but I think it\u2019s a dangerous precedent.\u201d\n\nWyden said his proposal would account for individuals and families who see the values of their assets decline after they pay tax on unrealized gains.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve always said is that losses would be considered as well. We\u2019ve talked about it. The president has talked about it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House budget office in a press release Monday explained that the tax would apply only to the wealthiest 0.01 percent of households, those with more than $100 million in assets. Half the estimated revenue it would produce would come from billionaires.\n\n\u201cIt would ensure that, in any given year, they pay at least 20 percent of their total income in Federal income taxes,\u201d the Office of Management and Budget said.\n\nTax and financial planning experts warn that Biden\u2019s proposal would be very difficult to implement and would result in a huge tax hit on the very rich.\n\nMallon FitzPatrick, a managing director at Robertson Stephens, a boutique wealth management firm, said the proposal would make it tougher to pass on legacy wealth.\n\n\u201cA lot of this proposal is aiming at people who are just slowly growing assets and not paying any tax because they\u2019re not realizing any gain and are expecting to pass on wealth to their heirs or whomever without paying taxes on it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mega, mega wealthy rely on that.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I think it\u2019s unpopular,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he added it\u2019s \u201chard to enforce.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking for the first time that I know of for people to report net worth,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to self-report or have a professional report how wealthy they are.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just [very] complex as I read it,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt\u2019s not fully fleshed out.\u201d\n\nUnder Biden\u2019s plan, taxpayers with more than $100 million in wealth would be required to report to the IRS on an annual basis the total estimated value of their assets in specified classes as well as their liabilities.\n\nMore liquid assets such as stock would be valued by using year-end market prices to determine unrealized capital gains.\n\nThe increase in value of nontradeable assets such as businesses and real estate would be determined by what the Treasury Department is calling a \u201cconservative floating annual return\u201d calculated by the five-year Treasury rate plus 2 percentage points.\n\nTaxpayers would be able to pay off the big initial tax hit in nine annual installments.\n\nFitzPatrick called the proposal a \u201cderivative\u201d of Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-Mass.) proposal to implement a 2 percent annual tax on the net worth of households and trusts between $50 million and $1 billion and a 1 percent annual surtax \u2014 or 3 percent overall \u2014 on the net worth of households and trusts above $1 billion.\n\nHe said the proposal potentially could tax the unrealized gains of assets going back years or decades.\n\nWarren on Tuesday praised the president\u2019s proposal as something that would address some of the constitutional concerns raised about her own plan, which has been criticized by some Republicans as an unconstitutional seizure of wealth.\n\n\u201cThe president wants to do it all. Invest in education, health care, housing and reduce the deficit and he\u2019s willing to ask billionaires to pay more in taxes to get that done,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking of the billionaires tax, she said, \u201cI would have gone further, but I like the direction the president is going in.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has quite elegantly sidestepped the constitutional issue that some people wanted to raise in connection with my proposal,\u201d she said. \u201cThe president has taken that issue off the table, and good for him.\u201d\n\nBiden's tax plan needs the support of every member of the Senate Democratic Conference to pass the upper chamber, as no Republican would vote for it.\n\nDemocrats are still hoping to pass some kind of tax reform under the budget reconciliation process to circumvent a GOP filibuster."

That implies a 48% cumulative probability in the next two years versus 35% previously.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe now see recession risk as higher and more front-load,\u201d economists led by Jan Hatzius wrote in the note. \u201cThe main reasons are that our baseline growth path is now lower and that we are increasingly concerned that the Fed will feel compelled to respond forcefully to high headline inflation and consumer inflation expectations if energy prices rise further, even if activity slows sharply.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nSeeking to quell the surge in living costs, the US Federal Reserve accelerated its monetary-tightening campaign last week, executing the biggest interest-rate hike since 1994.\r  \n\r  \nWhile comparisons with the 1960s and 1970s are ringing louder, the Goldman economists said hot wage growth and high inflation expectations are less entrenched today as back then.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat might a recession look like? With no major imbalances to unwind, a recession caused by moderate overtightening would most likely be shallow, though even shallower recessions have seen the unemployment rate rise by about 2\u00bdpercentage points on average,\u201d the Goldman economists wrote. \u201cOne additional concern this time is that the fiscal and monetary policy response might be more limited than usual.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWhile the economists maintained their second quarter growth forecast of 2.8%, they cut their outlook from the third quarter of this year through to the first quarter of 2023, and now forecast growth of 1.75%, 0.75% and 1%, respectively, in each of those quarters."

But that doesn\u2019t mean consumers were happy about paying more for the same goods, which is why the University of Michigan\u2019s sentiment index has steadily deteriorated to the lowest since 2011.\r  \n\r  \nSteadily Deteriorating\r  \nConsumer sentiment has dropped to its lowest since 2011\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSources: University of Michigan, Bloomberg\r  \n\r  \nThe line from the bulls has been to watch what consumers do, not what they say. And for the most part, the bulls have been right about consumer spending, which is why many investors remain positive on stocks and the riskier parts of the credit markets. Although Americans have griped about higher prices, they have kept buying goods and have increasingly gone out to eat and started traveling as the pandemic waned.\r  \n\r  \nBut the latest surge in inflation rates, stemming in part from rising energy prices as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has pushed many households to the breaking point. Energy prices have surged about 26% over the past year while food costs have jumped 8% in the largest increase since 1981, according to Joseph Lavorgna, the chief economist at Natixis North America LLC. These two inputs account for more than 20% of household outlays, he wrote in a March 23 research note. \r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, the big increase in homes prices and the recent increase in 30-year mortgages rates to 4.5% from about 3% last year has pushed home loan payments as a percent of family income to 22.4% on average for new buyers from 18.7%, according to Tom Porcelli, the chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets. Standard Chartered Bank strategist Steven Englander calculates that housing affordability is the lowest since 2007, with costs an estimated 15% higher in March than December.\r  \n\r  \nRetail sales data have been resilient on a nominal basis, supported by inflation that isn't stripped out of the numbers. But a look at unit sales of general merchandise goods such as apparel, footwear, toys and sports equipment dropped in nine out of 10 weeks between the end of December and early March on a year-over-year basis, according to NPD Group data cited in a recent Wall Street Journal article. The report noted that 43% of consumers recently surveyed said they would delay less-important purchases if prices kept going up.\r  \n\r  \nAnalysts expect this trend to show up in Thursday\u2019s personal consumption data, with the pace of increased spending expected to lag behind the inflation rate. It will also be important to watch the saving rate, which has dropped back to pre-pandemic levels. If the rate falls further, it may show that consumers are whittling down cash piles built up during the pandemic. Even if the rate stays the same, it may indicate that the days of profligate, pandemic-era spending are over.\r  \n\r  \nBack to Normal\r  \nThe U.S. personal saving rate has dropped to pre-pandemic levels\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSources: U.S. Commerce Dept., Bloomberg\r  \n\r  \nThe shift among consumers has been subtle, but one that has consequences amid the monetary and fiscal policy tightening that is currently happening. Consumer spending accounts for almost 70% of the annual economic output, up from around 60% in the early 1980s, the last time consumer price inflation was as high as it is now. The more consumers push back on higher prices, the bigger the ripple effect throughout the economy. Companies will see their profit margins shrink, diminishing their appetite  to expand, invest or hire new people who are demanding substantially higher wages. \r  \n\r  \nThis isn't a reason to sell stocks or high-yield bonds outright. Many companies still have high cash balances and they have taken advance of buoyant credit markets in recent years to extend their debt maturities at historically low interest rates. But at the same time, the emerging weakness in consumer spending is enough to suggest that it's no longer safe to employ a \u201cbuy the dip\u201d investing strategy like it was just a couple of months ago.\r  \n\r  \nThe longer consumers rein in their spending in response to the highest rates of inflation since the early 1980s, the more difficult it will be to emerge from the recession that seems increasingly inevitable. As we now know, recessions resulting from sudden exogenous shocks, such as the Covid-19 pandemic-induced on in 2020, can be reversed or offset extremely loose monetary policy and extremely generous fiscal policy. We may be about to find out that recessions born out of stagflationary shocks are harder to mitigate.\r  \n\r  \nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\r  \n\r  \nTo contact the author of this story:\r  \nLisa Abramowicz at labramowicz@bloomberg.net\r  \n\r  \nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\r  \nRobert Burgess at bburgess@bloomberg.net"

Then the global market gets turned upside down due to poor planning in Europe coming back to bite them in the ass and a consumer boycott of Russian supply over the invasion of Ukraine.

He's just been trying to bully them into refining more when there's no slack capacity available to do more.  If he really wants to do something productive to address this issue so it isn't a problem again next year he needs to work with the EPA and these companies to make sure the permitting goes through and work with legislators to get a bill for accelerated depreciation on the modernization and upgrading of these facilities through to derisk this investment for refiners here.\n\nMarkets are the ones who have pushed up the price of gasoline here, specifically to incentivize refiners not to shut down facilities and try to make upgrades or focus on different products that might not be optimal from a process standpoint.  Crack spreads are going to remain elevated until the summer driving season is over here regardless specifically because there is no quick solution to these problems.

In the UK, gas prices for next-day delivery surged as much as 33 per cent to \u00a34.80 a therm ($57 per million BTU).\n\nThe rise in European TTF prices to more than 14 times their average of the past decade may crimp industrial production in mainland Europe and push the region into recession, traders and economists have said. Widespread fears of shortages this winter have led gas users to try to lock in supplies, pushing up prices even as fears of a severe economic slowdown grow.\n\nThe euro initially breached parity with the US dollar in July, but had rebounded. The latest fall reflects both concerns about the energy crisis and also a broad rise in the dollar turbocharged by expectations the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates much more aggressively than the European Central Bank.\n\n\u201cThe end of summer sees the euro back under pressure, partly because the dollar is [rising] and partly because the Damoclean sword hanging over the European economy isn\u2019t going away,\u201d said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n\nThe latest surge in gas prices had been triggered by an announcement by Gazprom, Russia\u2019s state-backed gas monopoly, late on Friday that it was planning maintenance on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany early next month, traders said.\n\nGazprom has already slashed capacity on the line to just 20 per cent of the norm, triggering a more than doubling in gas prices in mainland Europe since June, with European officials accusing Moscow of \u201cweaponising\u201d supplies following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThere are fears that any maintenance could be used as a pretext for a prolonged shutdown of the line, with Moscow having blamed the capacity reduction on western sanctions interrupting its normal maintenance schedule.\n\n\u201cThere are some in the market who expect flows on Nord Stream 1 to not return after the September maintenance,\u201d said James Waddell at Energy Aspects.\n\n\u201cWe need to see significant additional demand destruction\u2009in that scenario to guarantee enough supplies for priority consumers like households and essential services, so without further curtailments in consumption being mandated by governments we risk seeing increasingly extreme prices.\u201d\n\nGiven the elevated level of gas prices, a 10 per cent daily rise now creates an enormous change in the absolute level of gas prices. It sets a gloomy tone ahead of winter as many governments prepare to shield their populations from the worst of the gas shock.\n\nGas prices in Europe were also responding to a surge in the price of liquefied natural gas in Asia, where state-backed utilities are starting purchases ahead of the winter. Europe needs to compete with large Asia LNG importers such as China, Japan and South Korea to secure the limited amount of LNG cargoes not tied up under long-term supply agreements.\n\nLNG prices in Asia have risen above $57 per million British thermal unit, with some cargoes being offered at about $60 per million BTU."

Some potential buyers are sitting on the sidelines until rates or prices or both decline, while sellers are hoping the market picks up again so they can get a higher price. \n\nBut don\u2019t count on rates falling to those pandemic lows. They were the result of extraordinary market manipulation from the Fed. And unless this becomes a regular feature of monetary policy, rates are not going back to what they used to be.\n\nThe real estate market has been on a wild ride. House prices, measured by the Case-Schiller index, increased 30% between March 2020 and December 2021, a steeper rise than the lead-up to end the housing bubble in 2008. This was in part because many people moved during the pandemic, but also because the 30-year mortgage rate was only 2.65% in spring of 2021. \n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe impact of the Fed\u2019s interference may be felt for years. In the spring of 2020, the Fed was desperate to avoid economic collapse, so it reverted to its 2008 playbook. It cut rates to zero and brought back quantitative easing, buying long-dated government bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Most residential mortgages are securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and resold in what is known as an agency MBS. \n\nIn 2020, the mortgage-backed security market was in trouble, and the Fed was even more aggressive than it was in 2008. It effectively became the only ultimate buyer of these securities: Its holdings of agency MBS increased by $1.3 trillion between 2020 and 2022, while the market for agency mortgage-backed securities grew by $1.5 trillion. The Federal Reserve now holds more than 40% of the total outstanding amount of agency MBS, or nearly half the market. \n\nThese actions were one big reason rates fell so low. Your mortgage rate is based on the 10-year bond rate, plus a premium for the extra risk involved. The size of that risk premium is largely determined in the MBS market, based on the liquidity and rate risk the investor takes on. The figure below shows the Bloomberg US MBS index minus the yield on 10-year bonds. \n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe spread spiked at the start of the pandemic, but then as the Fed kept buying it fell to nearly zero, and the housing market raged. The spread started rising again in June once the end of QE was in sight, and it rose further when the Fed started to taper its purchases in the fall of 2021 before stopping in early 2022. The spread is now higher than it was before the pandemic. \n\nBuying mortgage-backed securities may have made sense in spring 2020, but why the Fed did not start tapering for 18 months, even as the housing market was clearly overheating, was never explained. Whether quantitative easing actually helps the economy remains a divisive topic among economists. Fed economists insist it does help, while academic economists are more skeptical. But there is evidence that when the Fed buys mortgage-backed securities, it brings down MBS spreads and the mortgage rate.\n\nEven though the Fed has ended QE, its role in fueling the screwy housing market may last for the next decade. The Fed would like to shrink the size of its MBS portfolio. So far it plans to do so by not reinvesting all the securities as mortgages are paid off. \n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut higher rates mean fewer people will refinance or move, so the mortgage portfolio won\u2019t shrink as fast as the Fed anticipates. There are some whispers about the Fed selling some of its mortgage-backed securities. If that\u2019s the case, Charles Schwab expects the MBS spread will grow even larger, and odds are so will your mortgage rates. \n\nThere will also be a hangover from the very low rates in 2020 and 2021. Like many people, I bought a home in the spring of 2021. Now between rising rates and a slower housing market, I am not sure I can ever afford to move. The housing market may be slower and less liquid for a long time.\n\nThe MBS market may be less liquid, too. Their buyers normally assume that a large number of mortgages won\u2019t last 30 years because people move or refinance. But given that so many people got artificially cheap mortgages before rates went up means their behavior, and the duration of mortgage-backed securities, will be much less predictable. It will be a riskier asset that commands a larger spread. \n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe Fed has come under lots of criticism lately for being too late to raise rates in response to inflation. But another policy error could be that it kept buying so many mortgage-backed securities later in 2020 and most of 2021 when the housing market was on fire and rates kept dropping. \n\nA 2.6% fixed rate on a 30-year risky asset never made much sense. It suggests something is off in the market, either through some manipulation or a mis-pricing of risk. The Fed created major distortions in a market where many Americans have most of their wealth, and the impact may be felt for decades."

Firms convert a deflating dollar into housing as an investment- they buy up property, rehab it, rent it out, refinance it under favorable 2.5% interest rates on 30 year loans, take their cash back out to use on another investment and as long as the return on that other investment (combined with rental income) is higher than the interest rate means they are able to repeat the process practically ad infinitum.  There are companies that have cropped up now that build out entire single family housing developments just to rent them out for 15 years or so and then sell them off before any major maintenance needs to be done.  This sort of business model wouldn't or at least shouldn't be possible if mortgage rates were at 6%+ because (in theory), the return on alternative investments would be more lucrative."
